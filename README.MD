## What exactly is Wilfred?

Wilfred is a simple [boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) manager. Similar to yeoman, but works with local folders. Add an existing folder as boilerplate and you're ready to go, no internet required.

## Installation

`npm install -g wilfred`

**Optional:**

To use autocompletion on Wilfred, add the following lines to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc.

```bash 
if [ -f $(npm root -g)/wilfred/autocomplete/wilfred-completion.bash ]; then
    . $(npm root -g)/wilfred/autocomplete/wilfred-completion.bash
fi
```
